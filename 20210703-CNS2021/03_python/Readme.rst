**Abstract**


Python is amongst the most widely used programming languages today, and is increasingly popular in the scientific domain. A large number of tools and simulators in use currently are either implemented in Python, or offer interfaces for their use via Python. Python programming is therefore a very sought after skill in the scientific community.

This tutorial is targeted towards people who have some experience with programming languages (e.g. MATLAB, C, C++, etc), but are relatively new to Python. It is structured to have you quickly up-and-running, giving you a feel of how things work in Python. We shall begin by demonstrating how to setup and manage virtual environments on your system, to help you keep multiple projects isolated. We'll show you how to install Python packages in virtual environments and how to manage them. This will be followed by a quick overview of very basic Python constructs, leading finally to a neuroscience-themed project that will give you the opportunity to bring together various programming concepts with some hands-on practice. 


**Prerequisites**

* shell (participants on Linux and MacOS are all set; see below for Windows users)
* Python 3.6.9 or higher (see below for info on installation)

Participants on Windows have several options to get hold of a shell environment without leaving familiar territory:

* Install `Git for Windows <https://gitforwindows.org/>`_, which includes a Git Bash emulation with most of the standard tools you might expect in a Linux/Unix environment, plus of course Git.
* Alternatively, `enable WSL2 <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#install-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux>`_ and `install Ubuntu <https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6>`_ as a virtual machine hosted by Windows. This Linux-on-Windows experience can be a smooth and safe first step into Linux territory.

You will find several resources online for info on installing Python. e.g. https://realpython.com/installing-python/


**Topics**

* Setting up and managing virtual environments
* Installing packages using PyPI (pip) and from Git repositories (e.g. GitHub)
* Quick Python 101 - lists, dicts, if...else, loops, functions, error handling, import, help, numpy, matplotlib
* Short neuroscience-themed project - modularizing the code
* Good practices - lint (Flake8)
